- Add schema validation tests for Cycling domain (cycling.schema.ts — 1 file, ~12 schemas including Strava webhook unions, enum validations, and VO2max input). Largest single untested schema file with complex union types that deserve boundary testing.
- Add schema validation tests for Stretching domain (stretch.schema.ts, stretching.schema.ts — 2 files, ~4 schemas). Adds test file count and validation coverage that helps close the Stretching B+ → A gap alongside its already-99% line coverage.
- Add schema validation tests for Recovery domain (recovery.schema.ts — 1 file). Adds validation coverage for health data input schemas; helps Health Sync B+ → A alongside its already-100% line coverage.
- Update quality-grades.md to mark "Calendar missing cycling activities" tech debt as complete — cycling activities are fully aggregated in calendar.service.ts (imports getCyclingActivities, transforms with TSS/duration, sets hasCycling flag) and tested in calendar.service.test.ts (6+ cycling-specific test cases). Re-grade Calendar from B+ toward A.
- Extract shared test utilities to eliminate remaining Firestore mock duplication across 11+ backend test files (backend refactor handoff item). Audit all test files for inline mock patterns that should use createFirestoreMocks/setupFirebaseMock from test-utils/ or createMock*Repository from __tests__/utils/, and migrate stragglers.
- Migrate remaining domains to Zod-only DTO types — eliminate three-layer type duplication (manual DTO interface + Zod schema + z.infer) in ~7 domains (GuidedMeditation, TodayCoach, Progression, PlanModification, MealPlan, Recipe, Ingredient) by creating missing schemas and replacing manual interfaces with z.infer<> aliases exported from schema files.
- Expand createResourceRouter factory adoption from 2 handlers to all pure-CRUD handlers — recipes, ingredients, stretches, and exercises handlers manually wire the same GET/POST/PUT/DELETE patterns that the factory already handles for meals and barcodes. Migration reduces boilerplate and enforces consistent REST + error handling patterns.
- Add a doc-freshness CI lint check that detects stale documentation — specifically, tech debt items in quality-grades.md marked unchecked when the underlying code is complete, architecture maps referencing deleted/renamed files, and AGENTS.md guide links pointing to missing docs. Inspired by the Codex agent team article's "doc-gardening" pattern; prevents false signals that mislead planning agents.
