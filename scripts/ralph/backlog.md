- Add `docs/index.md` and a linter check that fails on broken internal markdown links or references to missing scripts/files (for example, `scripts/setup-ios-testing.sh`).
- Add `npm run test:integration:emulator` that starts emulators in the background, waits with `scripts/wait-for-emulator.sh`, runs integration tests, and always tears down cleanly.
- Generate `firebase.json` rewrites from a typed endpoint manifest (or handler export map) and validate parity in lint checks so route updates are not maintained by hand.
