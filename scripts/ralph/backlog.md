- Implement plan rust-migrate-pre-commit-hook: migrate hooks/pre-commit routing and policy logic to a Rust engine with a shim hook.
- Implement plan agents-rust-dev-tooling-guidance: add explicit agent guidance to prefer Rust for non-trivial dev tooling.
- Add `typescript-eslint` cleanup tasks to reduce noise from the temporary oxlint suppression.
- Re-enable `typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-type-assertion` in repositories and middleware after targeted type-guard refactors.
- Re-enable `typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-type-assertion` once broad `as` casts are replaced with schema-safe parsing.
- Re-enable `typescript-eslint/no-base-to-string` after replacing implicit string coercions in serialization paths.
