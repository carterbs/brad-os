# Training Philosophy for Maximizing FTP and VO2max in Time-Constrained, Previously Trained Cyclists: An Evidence-Based Framework

## Executive Summary

This report synthesizes current research on optimal training strategies for improving functional threshold power (FTP) and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in cyclists limited to approximately 3 hours per week of cycling training while maintaining concurrent strength training (2 hours/week). The evidence overwhelmingly supports high-intensity interval training (HIIT) over traditional volume-based approaches for time-constrained athletes, with specific protocols demonstrating superior adaptations in both central (cardiovascular) and peripheral (muscular) systems. This framework challenges conventional polarized training models that require 10+ hours weekly and instead leverages intensity-focused protocols proven effective in populations training 3-6 hours per week.

Critically, this framework recognizes that physiological optimization is meaningless without adherence. For recreational athletes, enjoyment is not a luxury—it is a prerequisite for consistency. The weekly structure therefore dedicates two sessions to structured, evidence-based work and reserves one session entirely for fun. A program that delivers 90% of the theoretical adaptive stimulus but is actually followed for months will always outperform a "perfect" program abandoned after three weeks.

## 1. Context and Physiological Rationale

### 1.1 The Volume-Constrained Athlete Reality

Traditional endurance training literature predominantly examines athletes training 7-12 hours per week or more. A systematic review by Torrontegui et al. (2023) found that trained non-elite cyclists typically require 7-12 hours weekly for optimal adaptations, with both pyramidal and polarized training intensity distributions (TID) proving effective at these volumes. However, this volume threshold creates a critical knowledge gap for athletes constrained to significantly lower training time.

The physiological reality is that aerobic adaptations require sufficient training stimulus, but the relationship between volume and adaptation is non-linear. A landmark meta-analysis by Cove et al. (2024) examining 41 studies with 797 trained cyclists found no significant association between weekly training volume and improvements in VO2max or time-trial performance once a base threshold was met. More critically, the analysis revealed that training duration had a stronger influence on adaptations than absolute volume, suggesting that intensity distribution matters more than total hours for cyclists unable to achieve high weekly volumes.

### 1.2 Detraining and Retraining Dynamics

For previously trained individuals returning from periods of reduced activity, the physiological landscape differs from truly untrained populations. Research on muscle memory has primarily focused on resistance training, where Seaborne et al. (2024) demonstrated that skeletal muscle retains epigenetic signatures following training-detraining-retraining cycles, potentially facilitating enhanced adaptation. However, Lindholm et al. (2016) found no evidence of improved endurance training response following detraining in a leg endurance study, suggesting that endurance muscle memory may be less pronounced than strength-based adaptations.

Critically, strength retention following detraining significantly exceeds muscle mass retention. Psilander et al. (2019) observed that after 20 weeks of detraining, strength remained elevated at ~60% above baseline despite muscle thickness and cross-sectional area returning to baseline values, supporting a neural learning component. This suggests that previously trained cyclists may retain neuromuscular efficiency while experiencing substantial decrements in metabolic capacity, creating a specific adaptive profile where metabolic systems require aggressive retraining while motor patterns remain partially preserved.

### 1.3 The Adherence Problem

The exercise science literature overwhelmingly focuses on what produces optimal physiological adaptations under controlled conditions. Yet the dominant predictor of real-world training outcomes is not protocol design—it is adherence. Dishman (1988) established that approximately 50% of individuals who begin an exercise program drop out within 6 months, a figure that has remained remarkably stable across decades of research. Rhodes & Kates (2015) found that affective responses during exercise—how the exercise *feels*—are among the strongest predictors of future exercise behavior, stronger than objective fitness improvements or health knowledge.

For recreational athletes who train by choice rather than profession, a program that is physiologically suboptimal but genuinely enjoyable will produce better long-term outcomes than a theoretically superior program that feels like punishment. This is not a concession to laziness; it is a recognition that consistency over months and years is the single most important variable in endurance development, and consistency requires that the athlete actually wants to train.

## 2. Training Intensity Distribution for Time-Constrained Athletes

### 2.1 The Polarized Training Paradox

Polarized training—characterized by 75-80% of training volume at low intensity (Zone 1), 0-5% at moderate intensity (Zone 2), and 15-20% at high intensity (Zone 3)—has demonstrated superiority in trained athletes with adequate training volume. Stöggl & Sperlich (2014) found that polarized training produced the greatest increase in VO2peak (+11.7%) compared to threshold training (+3.6%), HIIT (+7.6%), or high-volume training (+3.1%) over 9 weeks in well-trained endurance athletes (VO2peak: 62.6 mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹).

Similarly, Neal et al. (2013) demonstrated that 6 weeks of polarized training (80% low/20% high intensity, 6.4 hours/week) produced superior adaptations compared to threshold training (57% low/43% moderate, 7.5 hours/week) in trained cyclists: peak power output (+8% vs +3%), lactate threshold (+9% vs +2%), and high-intensity exercise capacity (+85% vs +37%).

However, these findings carry a critical constraint: polarized training requires sufficient total volume to accumulate adequate high-intensity work. With only 3 hours of weekly cycling training, achieving 20% high-intensity work (36 minutes) leaves just 2.4 hours for low-intensity training—insufficient to drive the peripheral adaptations (mitochondrial biogenesis, capillarization) that polarized training leverages. The model assumes 7-12+ hours weekly to be effective.

### 2.2 Low-Volume High-Intensity Interval Training: The Evidence

For athletes training <5 hours per week, the research converges on a different optimal strategy. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Yin et al. (2024) specifically examining low-volume HIIT (defined as ≤15 minutes of high-intensity exercise per session and ≤30 minutes total session duration) found a large effect on cardiorespiratory fitness (SMD = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.87-1.50) compared to control groups. Critically, this analysis revealed an **inverse dose-response relationship**: greater number of repetitions (β = -0.52), longer high-intensity duration (β = -0.21), and longer total session duration (β = -0.19) were all associated with **lower** gains in cardiorespiratory fitness.

This counterintuitive finding is explained by the distinction between supramaximal intensity (sprint interval training, SIT) and maximal intensity (traditional HIIT). SIT protocols achieved superior outcomes with lower volume because they maximized time at or near VO2max despite shorter work intervals.

Supporting evidence from Alves et al. (2013) demonstrated that untrained males achieved 9.6-9.7% improvements in VO2max after just 4 weeks with only 3 sessions per week using either all-out 30-second sprints or submaximal intervals. Ramos et al. (2020) found that sedentary men showed +9.4% average VO2max improvement (with individual responses up to 28.9%) using HIIT protocols (15 × 30 seconds at 90-95% HRmax) compared to only +5.9% with moderate-intensity continuous training over 8 weeks.

### 2.3 Time Accumulation at VO2max: The Critical Variable

The mechanistic explanation for HIIT superiority centers on time accumulated at or near VO2max. Seiler's research, widely cited across interval training literature, established that time spent above 90% HRmax (corresponding approximately to 90% VO2max) represents a major training stimulus for improving VO2max. Rønnestad et al. (2020) compared different interval designs and found that progressively decreasing intervals (starting with longer efforts and gradually reducing interval length) accumulated 312 seconds above 90% VO2peak compared to only 183 seconds for short intervals and 179 seconds for long intervals of constant duration.

This finding has profound implications for programming: the goal is not simply "high intensity" but specifically maximizing time in the VO2max zone. Billat's 30-30 protocol (30 seconds hard/30 seconds recovery) allowed runners to maintain VO2 near maximal levels 2-3 times longer than constant-pace efforts by providing just enough recovery to prevent complete fatigue while insufficient recovery to allow VO2 to drop significantly between intervals.

For FTP improvement specifically, work at 88-94% of FTP (sweet spot training) has been widely promoted as optimal for time-constrained cyclists. However, the research support is primarily anecdotal rather than empirical. No controlled studies directly compare sweet spot training to VO2max intervals in time-constrained populations. The theoretical advantage—sustainable high intensity without excessive fatigue—must be weighed against the opportunity cost: time spent at sweet spot is time NOT spent at VO2max intensity, potentially limiting the ceiling for VO2max improvement.

## 3. Concurrent Training: Optimizing Strength and Endurance Integration

### 3.1 The Interference Effect: Updated Evidence

Historical concerns about concurrent training suppressing strength and hypertrophy adaptations have been substantially revised by recent meta-analyses. Wilson et al. (2012) identified that the interference effect is modality, frequency, and duration dependent, with running showing greater interference than cycling. Critically, **cycling-based endurance training concurrent with resistance training did not result in significant decrements in hypertrophy or strength**.

The most comprehensive recent analysis by Schumann et al. (2024) examined 43 studies with 1,090 subjects and found that concurrent aerobic and strength training did **not** lead to significantly smaller strength gains than resistance training alone (SMD = -0.06, p = 0.45) nor significantly less hypertrophy (SMD = -0.01, p = 0.92). However, concurrent training did lead to significantly smaller improvements in explosive strength (SMD = -0.28, p = 0.007).

### 3.2 Mechanisms and Mitigation Strategies

The prevailing mechanistic model has shifted from chronic molecular interference (competing AMPK/mTOR signaling pathways) to acute residual fatigue. Fernandez-Fernandez et al. (2025) propose that the interference phenomenon primarily reflects inadequate recovery between modalities rather than incompatible adaptive signals. This model is supported by evidence that peripheral adaptations (muscle oxidative capacity) are similar across moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), HIIT, and SIT protocols, contradicting the hypothesis that different intensity domains create conflicting molecular signals.

**Key mitigation strategies supported by evidence:**

1. **Modality selection**: Cycling produces significantly less interference than running (Wilson et al., 2012), likely due to reduced eccentric loading and muscle damage.

2. **Session sequencing**: Performing resistance training before endurance training in same-day sessions preserves neuromuscular quality for strength work (multiple studies in Schumann et al., 2024 meta-analysis).

3. **Inter-session recovery**: Separating strength and endurance sessions by ≥3 hours minimizes interference, particularly for explosive strength preservation (Schumann et al., 2024).

4. **Endurance intensity distribution**: Using HIIT/SIT rather than MICT for concurrent training appears to minimize interference. The high-intensity work is time-efficient and produces comparable oxidative adaptations with less total systemic fatigue than extended moderate-intensity sessions (Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 2025).

5. **Frequency management**: Correlational analyses identified significant negative relationships between frequency of endurance training and hypertrophy (-0.26 to -0.35), strength (-0.26 to -0.35), and power (-0.26 to -0.35) adaptations (Wilson et al., 2012). However, these relationships are not causal and likely reflect total training load rather than frequency per se.

For an athlete training 3 hours cycling and 2 hours resistance training weekly, the evidence suggests minimal interference risk provided sessions are appropriately structured.

## 4. Evidence-Based Training Framework

### 4.1 Primary Training Objectives

**Objective 1: Maximize time accumulated at VO2max**
Rationale: VO2max improvements require exposure to intensities that elicit maximal cardiac output and oxygen extraction. Time at 90-100% VO2max is the critical stimulus (Seiler, 2010; Rønnestad et al., 2020).

**Objective 2: Improve sustainable power at threshold**
Rationale: FTP represents the boundary between heavy and severe exercise domains and is the primary determinant of cycling time-trial performance. Both adaptations at VO2max (raising the ceiling) and at lactate threshold (raising the sustainable percentage of VO2max) contribute to FTP improvement.

**Objective 3: Minimize training volume required for adaptation**
Rationale: With 3 hours weekly, every minute of structured training must maximize adaptive stimulus. Low-volume HIIT protocols demonstrate superior efficiency (Yin et al., 2024).

**Objective 4: Sustain long-term adherence through enjoyment**
Rationale: The best training program is the one that gets done consistently. Reserving one weekly session for unstructured, enjoyable riding protects against the monotony and psychological burden that cause recreational athletes to abandon structured programs. This is not wasted training time—it is an investment in the months and years of consistency that ultimately determine fitness outcomes.

### 4.2 Session Structure and Distribution

#### Weekly Template (3 Cycling Sessions)

The framework concentrates all structured, evidence-based training into two weekday sessions, freeing the weekend session for whatever form of cycling the athlete finds most enjoyable. Two focused sessions per week is sufficient to drive meaningful adaptation in time-constrained athletes (Yin et al., 2024; Scott et al., 2025), while the third session serves a different but equally important purpose: keeping the athlete engaged with cycling as something they *want* to do.

**Session 1 (Tuesday): VO2max Intervals - Short Duration, High Intensity**
- **Duration**: 45-60 minutes total
- **Protocol**: Sprint interval training (SIT) or short HIIT
- **Evidence-based options**:
  - 30/30 intervals (Billat protocol): 10-15 x 30 seconds all-out / 30 seconds easy (Billat et al., 2000)
  - 30/120 intervals: 6-8 x 30 seconds all-out / 120 seconds recovery (Scott et al., 2025)
  - 40/20 intervals: 15-20 x 40 seconds hard / 20 seconds easy (Ronnestad et al., 2020)

**Rationale**: These protocols maximize time at or near VO2max through incomplete recovery. The all-out nature ensures rapid achievement of VO2max, while brief recovery prevents complete restoration, maintaining elevated cardiovascular demand. Scott et al. (2025) demonstrated +3.1 mL/kg/min VO2peak improvement in previously inactive adults using 30/120 protocols 3x/week for 6 weeks. Even at a reduced frequency of once per week, this session provides the primary VO2max stimulus that drives ceiling-level cardiovascular adaptation.

**Session 2 (Thursday): Threshold Development**
- **Duration**: 45-60 minutes total
- **Protocol**: Sweet spot or threshold intervals
- **Evidence-based options**:
  - 3 x 10-15 minutes at 88-94% FTP / 5 minutes recovery (sweet spot)
  - 2 x 20 minutes at 88-94% FTP / 5-10 minutes recovery (sweet spot)
  - 4 x 8-10 minutes at 95-105% FTP / 3-4 minutes recovery (threshold)

**Rationale**: While research directly validating sweet spot training is limited, work near but below threshold allows accumulation of significant time-in-zone with manageable fatigue. This session complements Session 1: where VO2max intervals raise the aerobic ceiling, threshold work raises the percentage of that ceiling that can be sustained. Together, these two structured sessions address both primary physiological targets (VO2max and FTP). For athletes with limited recovery capacity due to life stress, this session can be adjusted to endurance pace (70-80% FTP) without compromising the primary adaptation stimulus from Session 1.

**Session 3 (Saturday): Fun**
- **Duration**: 30-90 minutes (athlete's choice)
- **Protocol**: Whatever the athlete enjoys most

**Rationale**: This session exists to protect long-term adherence—the single most important variable in training outcomes. Recreational athletes train by choice. When every session is a structured suffer-fest, that choice becomes harder to make each week. By reserving Saturday for unstructured enjoyment, the framework accomplishes several things:

1. **Psychological relief**: Two hard, structured sessions per week is sustainable. Three is where many recreational athletes begin to dread training and eventually quit.
2. **Intrinsic motivation**: The athlete maintains a connection to cycling as something enjoyable, not just medicine to be endured.
3. **Incidental fitness**: Fun riding still produces training stimulus. A group ride, an exploration of new roads, a scenic climb, a Peloton class chosen purely by mood—these all involve pedaling, and pedaling at any intensity contributes to aerobic base development, even if suboptimally.
4. **Social connection**: Many of the most enjoyable cycling activities (group rides, riding with friends or family) are inherently social, adding a layer of accountability and meaning that structured solo intervals cannot provide.

The format is deliberately unspecified. It might be a casual group ride, a mountain bike trail, a Peloton scenic ride, laps around the neighborhood with a kid, or a hard Zwift race—whatever sounds appealing that week. The only rule is that the athlete should look forward to it. If Saturday starts to feel like another obligation, something has gone wrong.

### 4.3 Intensity Calibration

Precise intensity targets are critical for optimal adaptation in the two structured sessions. The research uses various markers (% VO2max, % HRmax, % FTP), requiring translation:

**VO2max Session (Session 1):**
- Target: >=90% VO2max
- Heart Rate equivalent: >=90% HRmax (approximation)
- Power equivalent: 105-120%+ FTP (highly variable)
- RPE: 8-9 out of 10
- **Practical marker**: Should be unable to sustain for >5-8 minutes continuously

**Threshold Session (Session 2):**
- Sweet Spot: 88-94% FTP / 85-93% HRmax / RPE 6-7
- At Threshold: 95-105% FTP / 93-97% HRmax / RPE 7-8
- **Practical marker**: Uncomfortable but sustainable for 20-40 minutes with focus

**Fun Session (Session 3):**
- No intensity target. Ride by feel.
- If it accidentally turns into a hard effort (a spirited group ride, chasing a Strava segment), that is fine—bonus training stimulus.
- If it ends up being an easy spin, that is also fine—active recovery and aerobic base.
- The point is that intensity is self-selected based on enjoyment, not prescribed.

### 4.4 Progression Model

A key finding from Wen et al. (2019) is that short-term HIIT (<=4 weeks) produces significant adaptations, but longer interventions (>=4-12 weeks) with greater volume yield larger effects. This suggests an initial intensive block followed by consolidation.

Progression applies to Sessions 1 and 2 only. Session 3 remains unstructured throughout.

**Weeks 1-2: Adaptation Phase**
- Purpose: Neuromuscular adaptation to high-intensity efforts
- Session 1: 8-10 x 30/30 or 5-6 x 30/120
- Session 2: 3 x 10-12 minutes sweet spot
- Session 3: Fun

**Weeks 3-4: Build Phase**
- Purpose: Increase volume of high-intensity work
- Session 1: 12-15 x 30/30 or 7-8 x 30/120
- Session 2: 2 x 15-20 minutes sweet spot OR 4 x 8-10 minutes threshold
- Session 3: Fun

**Week 5: Recovery Week**
- Purpose: Consolidate adaptations, prevent overreaching
- Reduce structured high-intensity time by 30-40%
- Session 1: 6-8 x 30/30 or 4-5 x 30/120
- Session 2: 2 x 10 minutes sweet spot (reduced volume)
- Session 3: Fun (an especially good week for a mellow ride)

**Weeks 6-7: Peak Phase**
- Purpose: Maximize high-intensity capacity
- Session 1: 15-20 x 40/20 or similar volume 30/30
- Session 2: 2 x 20 minutes sweet spot OR 4 x 10 minutes threshold
- Session 3: Fun

**Week 8: Test Week**
- Purpose: Validate adaptations
- Session 1: FTP test (20-minute or ramp protocol)
- Session 2: 30-minute endurance (recovery from test)
- Session 3: Fun (or OFF—athlete's choice)

Expected outcomes based on research (untrained/detrained populations, 6-8 week interventions):
- VO2max: +8-15% (Ramos et al., 2020; Milanovic et al., 2013)
- FTP: +10-25% (estimated from power at lactate threshold improvements in Neal et al., 2013; Stoggl & Sperlich, 2014)

Note: These estimates are derived from studies where all sessions were structured. With one session per week dedicated to fun, the absolute magnitude of improvement may be slightly lower, but the practical outcome—an athlete who actually completes the 8-week block rather than quitting at week 4—is likely superior.

### 4.5 Concurrent Training Integration

**Resistance Training Sessions (2 per week):**

Given the strength-retention findings from detraining research (Psilander et al., 2019), the resistance training primary objectives should be:
1. Maintain/regain muscle mass lost during detraining
2. Preserve neuromuscular power (jump height, explosive strength)
3. Support cycling performance through improved force production capacity

**Optimal scheduling to minimize interference:**

**Option A: Separate Days (Preferred if schedule permits)**
- Monday: Resistance Training (lower + upper body)
- Tuesday: Cycling Session 1 (SIT/Short HIIT)
- Wednesday: OFF
- Thursday: Cycling Session 2 (Threshold)
- Friday: Resistance Training (lower + upper body)
- Saturday: Cycling Session 3 (Fun)
- Sunday: OFF

**Option B: Same-Day Sessions**
- Tuesday: Resistance Training (AM) → Cycling Session 1 (PM, 3+ hours later)
- Wednesday: OFF
- Thursday: Cycling Session 2
- Friday: Resistance Training (AM) → Cycling Session 3 (PM, 3+ hours later)
- Saturday: OFF or light activity
- Sunday: OFF

**Option C: Minimizing Cycling Interference**
- Monday: Resistance Training
- Tuesday: Cycling Session 1
- Wednesday: OFF
- Thursday: Resistance Training
- Friday: Cycling Session 2
- Saturday: Cycling Session 3 (Fun)
- Sunday: OFF

Option C provides maximum recovery between strength and cycling sessions but may not be practical. The research (Schumann et al., 2024) supports all three options with minimal interference expected, particularly given cycling modality and relatively low cycling volume (3 hours/week).

Note that because Session 3 is unstructured and self-paced, it pairs well with any scheduling option. There is no need to protect it from prior-day fatigue the way a structured threshold session would require. If Friday legs are tired from resistance training, Saturday's fun ride can simply be easier—the athlete adjusts naturally because there is no prescribed intensity to hit.

**Resistance Training Structure:**
- Focus on compound movements: squat variations, deadlift variations, press variations, pull variations
- Volume: 3-4 exercises, 3-4 sets each, 6-12 repetitions
- Intensity: 70-85% 1RM range
- Avoid training to failure to minimize systemic fatigue

## 5. Practical Implementation Considerations

### 5.1 Indoor Training Specifics (Peloton Platform)

The research reviewed uses controlled laboratory settings (cycle ergometers with precise power control) or outdoor training. Indoor trainers provide superior control over interval execution but require adaptation:

1. **Use Power Zone structure**: Peloton's Power Zone classes align with research-based intensity distributions
2. **Class selection guidance**:
   - **Session 1**: Power Zone Max (PZ Max) classes with 30-second or 1-minute surges
   - **Session 2**: PZ Max classes with 3-5 minute sustained efforts in Zones 5-7, or Power Zone (PZ) classes emphasizing Zones 4-5
   - **Session 3**: Whatever class sounds appealing. A scenic ride, a music-themed ride, a live class with friends, a PZ Endurance class if that is what the athlete is in the mood for. The Peloton library is large enough that there is always something fun—the selection should be driven entirely by what the athlete wants to do that day.

3. **Self-directed alternatives**: Research protocols (30/30, 4x4, etc.) can be executed in free-ride mode with manual resistance adjustment

### 5.2 Monitoring and Adjustment

**Weekly monitoring metrics:**
- Resting heart rate (taken morning upon waking)
- Subjective recovery (1-10 scale)
- Session completion rate (did you finish prescribed intervals in Sessions 1 and 2?)
- Power output consistency across structured sessions
- Subjective enjoyment of Session 3 (are you still looking forward to it?)

**Indicators for reducing training load:**
- Resting HR elevated >5-7 bpm above baseline for 3+ consecutive days
- Inability to complete prescribed intervals (falling short by >2 intervals or >10% power)
- Subjective recovery <4/10 for multiple consecutive days
- Illness or non-training life stress
- Session 3 starts feeling like a chore rather than something to look forward to

The inverse dose-response relationship found by Yin et al. (2024) suggests that reducing interval count while maintaining intensity may be preferable to reducing intensity while maintaining count when fatigue is elevated.

When reducing load, reduce the structured sessions (fewer intervals in Session 1, shorter efforts in Session 2). Never sacrifice Session 3—if anything, a recovery week is an opportunity to do something especially enjoyable on Saturday.

### 5.3 Nutritional Considerations

While comprehensive nutritional guidance is beyond this report's scope, several evidence-based principles from the training literature warrant mention:

1. **Carbohydrate availability**: HIIT protocols generate significant glycolytic demand. Burgomaster et al. (2005) showed that even very low-volume SIT (6 sessions total) increased glycolytic enzyme activity. Adequate carbohydrate intake on training days supports interval completion and recovery.

2. **Train-low strategies**: Hansen et al. (2005) demonstrated that performing a second training session with low muscle glycogen enhanced metabolic adaptations compared to training with normal glycogen stores. However, this was in trained athletes—applicability to time-constrained athletes is uncertain and may compromise interval quality.

3. **Protein timing**: Given concurrent strength training, protein intake distributed across the day (particularly post-resistance training) supports muscle protein synthesis and recovery (Schoenfeld & Aragon, 2018).

## 6. Limitations and Future Research Needs

### 6.1 Study Population Mismatch

A critical limitation in applying this research is that most studies examine either (a) truly untrained/sedentary populations or (b) currently trained cyclists training 7-12+ hours weekly. The specific population of **previously trained but currently detrained cyclists with 3 hours weekly training time** is underrepresented in the literature.

Psilander et al. (2019) and Seaborne et al. (2024) provide insights on retraining following detraining, but both focused on resistance training rather than endurance adaptations. Lindholm et al. (2016) found no epigenetic memory benefits for endurance training, but this was a single study in a specific population.

The proposed framework extrapolates from untrained population studies (Scott et al., 2025; Ramos et al., 2020; Alves et al., 2013) based on the assumption that detrained individuals will respond similarly to untrained individuals metabolically, while potentially retaining some neuromuscular efficiency from prior training.

### 6.2 Sweet Spot Training Evidence Gap

The widespread promotion of sweet spot training (88-94% FTP) in cycling coaching literature lacks robust empirical validation in controlled studies. No randomized controlled trials directly compare sweet spot-focused training to VO2max interval training in time-constrained populations. The theoretical advantages are compelling but remain unverified.

### 6.3 Individual Variability

Bouchard et al.'s seminal HERITAGE Family Study demonstrated enormous individual variability in VO2max trainability, with some individuals showing minimal response to standardized training while others improved substantially. The meta-analytic averages presented in this report mask this heterogeneity. Close monitoring and individualized adjustment based on response is essential.

### 6.4 Long-Term Sustainability and Adherence

Most studies reviewed examine 4-12 week interventions. The proposed framework is designed as an intensive 8-week block. Long-term sustainability (6+ months) of high-intensity focused training in time-constrained athletes requires further investigation. Periodized variation (alternating intensive HIIT blocks with more moderate-intensity phases) is likely necessary for long-term progression and injury prevention, but optimal periodization schemes remain to be established.

The inclusion of an unstructured fun session is a deliberate hedge against the adherence problem that plagues structured training programs. While no controlled study has directly compared a "2 structured + 1 fun" distribution to "3 structured" sessions in this population, the exercise adherence literature strongly suggests that programs perceived as enjoyable are maintained longer (Rhodes & Kates, 2015). The long-term compounding effect of sustained training consistency likely outweighs the marginal per-session benefit of a third structured workout.

### 6.5 The Fun Session Evidence Gap

This framework makes an evidence-informed but not directly evidence-based claim: that replacing one structured session with unstructured enjoyable riding improves long-term outcomes. The exercise psychology literature supports the importance of enjoyment for adherence, and the physiology literature suggests that two high-quality sessions per week can drive meaningful adaptation. But no study has directly tested this specific trade-off in cyclists. This represents an opportunity for future research that could bridge the gap between exercise physiology and exercise psychology.

## 7. Conclusions

For a previously trained cyclist returning from detraining with severe time constraints (3 hours weekly cycling, 2 hours weekly resistance training), the evidence supports an intensity-focused training philosophy that balances physiological optimization with sustainable adherence:

**Core principles:**

1. **Maximize time at VO2max** through sprint interval training and short HIIT protocols (1 session/week, Tuesday)

2. **Develop threshold power** through sweet spot or threshold intervals (1 session/week, Thursday)

3. **Protect long-term adherence through enjoyment** by dedicating one session per week to unstructured, fun riding (Saturday)

4. **Minimize interference** between strength and endurance training through appropriate modality (cycling not running), session spacing (3+ hours or different days), and intensity distribution (HIIT/SIT not MICT)

5. **Progress systematically** from lower to higher interval volumes over 3-4 week blocks with integrated recovery weeks

6. **Monitor and adjust** based on individual response, recognizing substantial variability in trainability—and recognizing that dreading training is itself a signal that the program needs adjustment

The expected outcomes—8-15% VO2max improvement and 10-25% FTP improvement over 8 weeks—are based on studies in untrained/recreational populations using fully structured protocols and represent achievable targets provided the two structured sessions are executed consistently at prescribed intensities. The fun session may contribute additional aerobic stimulus depending on the activity chosen, but its primary value is in keeping the athlete engaged for the next 8-week block, and the one after that.

This framework should be understood as a starting point requiring individualization based on response, recovery capacity, and competing life demands. The theoretical foundations are sound and research-supported, but practical execution will necessitate ongoing adjustment. The most important adjustment of all is ensuring that the athlete continues to enjoy the process.
