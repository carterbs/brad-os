Basic Breathing Meditation Scripts

## Intro Phase

intro-welcome: Welcome to your meditation practice. Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. You can close your eyes whenever you're ready.

intro-posture: Let your shoulders drop away from your ears. Rest your hands gently in your lap, or by your sides. There's nothing you need to do right now, except be here.

## Breathing Phase

breathing-settle: Take a moment to notice how your body feels. You might feel the weight of your body against the surface beneath you. Let yourself settle into this moment. There's nowhere else you need to be.

breathing-rhythm: Now, gently bring your attention to your breath. Don't try to change it. Just notice the natural rhythm of breathing in, and breathing out.

breathing-reminder-1: If your mind has wandered, that's completely normal. Gently guide your attention back to your breath.

breathing-reminder-2: Notice the cool air as you breathe in, and the warm air as you breathe out. Each breath is an anchor to this present moment.

breathing-reminder-3: Let each exhale carry away any tension you're holding. There's nothing to figure out right now.

breathing-midpoint: You're doing beautifully. Continue following your breath, letting thoughts come and go like clouds passing through the sky.

breathing-deepen: With each breath, allow yourself to sink a little deeper into relaxation. Your body knows how to rest. Trust it.

## Closing Phase

closing-transition: Begin to let go of focusing on your breath. Allow your awareness to gently expand outward.

closing-awakening: Start to bring gentle movement back to your body. Maybe wiggle your fingers or toes. Take your time. There's no rush.

closing-gratitude: When you're ready, you can open your eyes. Thank you for taking this time for yourself. Carry this sense of calm with you as you continue your day.
