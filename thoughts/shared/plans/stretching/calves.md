Calf Stretches
Standing Calf Stretch: Stand facing a wall with your hands pressed against it. Step one foot back, keeping it flat on the ground and your knee straight. Bend your front knee and lean toward the wall until you feel a stretch in the calf of the back leg.

Downward-Facing Dog: Begin on all fours with your hands shoulder-width apart and knees hip-width apart. Lift your hips toward the ceiling, straightening your legs as much as possible while keeping your heels on the ground. Press your chest toward your thighs to deepen the stretch in your calves.

Wall Push-Up Calf Stretch: Stand facing a wall with one foot forward and one foot back. Keep your back heel flat on the ground and bend your front knee, leaning into the wall. You should feel a stretch in the calf of the back leg.
----
Bent-Knee Calf Stretch: Stand with both feet flat on the floor. Step one foot back, bend both knees slightly, and lean forward into the stretch. This variation targets the lower calf muscles.
----
Single-Leg Standing Calf Stretch: Stand on one leg, keeping the other leg straight and behind you with the heel on the ground. Lean forward slightly to stretch the calf of the standing leg.
