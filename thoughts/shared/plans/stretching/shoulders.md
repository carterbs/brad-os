Shoulder Stretches
Cross-Body Shoulder Stretch: Bring one arm across your chest at shoulder height. Use your opposite arm to gently pull the extended arm closer to your body, feeling the stretch in the shoulder.
----
Overhead Shoulder Stretch: Reach one arm overhead, bending the elbow so your hand drops between your shoulder blades. Use your other hand to gently press on the bent elbow, deepening the stretch in the shoulder and triceps.
----
Thread the Needle: Start on all fours. Slide one arm underneath the opposite arm, lowering your shoulder and ear to the ground. Extend the other arm forward, feeling a stretch in the shoulder and upper back.
----
Shoulder Shrugs: Stand or sit upright. Lift both shoulders towards your ears in a shrugging motion, then slowly release them back down. This helps relieve tension in the shoulder muscles.
----
Arm Behind the Back Stretch: Reach one arm behind your back, palm facing inward. Use the opposite hand to gently press the reaching arm downward and away from your body, stretching the shoulder and chest.
